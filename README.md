Here is my **Excel Clone**  build with pure JavaScript(ES6+), done by following [Vladilen Minin course](https://www.jsexcel.ru/)

***

### The purpose of this project is to learn modern JavaScript by building own framework that used as a core of application

Used technologies:

 - JavaScript ES6+
 - Webpack
 - Babel
 - Sass
 - Own Redux and Observer(Emitter)
 
After learning new stuff i comeback to this application and extend it by implementing new functionality

##

### Simple schemes, to have basic understanding of how it works:
